## This repository includes most of the topics from Corey Schafer's "Pandas for Data Analysts" playlist, along with my personal notes taken while following his tutorials.

The dataset used is the 2019 Stack Overflow Survey. You can download it from this link: (Stack Overflow Annual Developer Survey)[https://survey.stackoverflow.co/]

The download includes two datasets:

**Main Dataset** : A CSV file containing responses from all survey participants.

**Survey Schema** : A file providing information about each column in the main dataset, helping you understand the data better.

**Note** : Ensure the dataset is saved in the same folder as the code if you plan to run it. Otherwise, you'll need to modify the file path when loading the data using the Pandas library.
