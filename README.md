## This repository includes most of the topics from Corey Schafer's "Pandas for Data Analysts" playlist, along with my personal notes taken while following his tutorials.

The dataset used is the 2019 Stack Overflow Survey. You can download it from this link: (Stack Overflow Annual Developer Survey)[https://survey.stackoverflow.co/]

### 1) The download includes two datasets:

**Main Dataset** : A CSV file containing responses from all survey participants.

**Survey Schema** : A file providing information about each column in the main dataset, helping you understand the data better.

**Note** : Ensure the dataset is saved in the same folder as the code if you plan to run it. Otherwise, you'll need to modify the file path when loading the data using the Pandas library.

### 2) There are two notebooks in the Pandas Folder:

 **Snippets** :

- A simpler notebook with a basic dataset that we created to make it easier to understand different Pandas concepts.
- This is the one you should start with for each topic before moving on to the Demo notebook.\
  
**Demo** :

- This notebook applies the concepts learned in the Snippets notebook to a larger datasetâ€”the Stack Overflow survey dataset that you downloaded.

### 3) Plan:

The Pandas is divided into several parts, each discussing a specific topic.

For each topic:

- First, explore the Snippets notebook to understand the concept with a simple example.
- Then, check the Demo notebook to see how those concepts are applied to the Stack Overflow survey dataset.
